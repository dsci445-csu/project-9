# Actionable League of Legends Game Outcome Prediction Using Machine Learning Methods

## Research Questions:
1. Which data best accounts for the outcome of a specific match?
2. Is it possible to provide meaningful feedback to a player on a game using a model?

## Data Overview:
* Gathered from the Riot Games Developer API
* First party source
* Highly nested

## Our Data:
* 'Small' Dataset n=250 matches (2,500 players)
* 'Medium' Dataset n=5,000 matches (50,000 players)
* 'Large' Dataset n=50,000 (n=500,000 players)

## Data Features:
* Binary classification problem (win/loss)
*talk about the sort of features we have*

## Gold and Wins:
*graph about gold vs duration colored by win*

## Turrets:
*image to illustrate why they are important*
*graph about turrets lost and turret takedowns vs win*
*this is why we removed them from the data*

## The Research:
Nonlinear Models Dominate:
* Gonzalez, 2023, Deep Neural Network: 89.8%
* Zamir et al., 2024, RNN: 86.7%
* Silva et al., 2023, RNN: 73% (at 15m)
* Chen et al., 2021, Log. Regression: 60.24%
