# project-9

## Summary:
League of Legends is a massively popular online game where players can compete to increase their matchmaking rating. The creators of League of Legends, Riot Games, provide extremely dense data through an API. The goal of this project is to attempt to create a post-game performance review tool similar to the infamous review tool available for chess on chess.com. 


## Main Questions:
1. Which data available through the API best accounts for predicting the outcome of a given match?
2. Using our prediction model as a base, is it possible to provide meaningful feedback on a player's gameplay? (We will get the opinion of high-level players to benchmark this feedback)
