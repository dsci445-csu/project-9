# Actionable League of Legends Game Outcome Prediction Using Machine Learning Methods

## Motivation:
* League of Legends is a massively popular and competitive online 5v5 multiplayer online battle area (MOBA) game.
* Riot Games provides public high-quality data through its API.
    * Gain access to game data such as player performance and objectives.
* Existing websites focus on surface-level information (match history, specific counter picks), not the impact on player decision-making.
* Goal: Analyze and interpret player behavior to determine how these patterns influence the outcome of the game.
* Focus: Factors such as key behavioral patterns, player participation, objectives, and experience/gold levels.

## Research Questions:
The main questions we want to answer through this project are:
1. Which data best accounts for the outcome of a specific match?
2. Is it possible to provide meaningful feedback to a player on a game using a model?

***

## Data Overview:
* Data is from Riot Games developer API from patch 25.22 (Nov 1-3, 2025).
* Used python data collector to collect two different API endpoints:
    * Match Data - end-of-game summary statistic (game outcome, characters played, ending gold quantity)
    * Timelines Data - 1-minute snapshot intervals of player location, inventory, events.
* Highly nested JSONL, requires precise extraction.
* Collected from games where average matchmatking of players was 'Diamond II' (top 1.5% skill).
    * Focuses on high-quality   

***

## Our Data:
* 'Small' Dataset n=250 matches (2,500 players)
* 'Medium' Dataset n=5,000 matches (50,000 players)
* 'Large' Dataset n=50,000 (n=500,000 players)

## Fitting an SVM

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyr")
library(jsonlite) # imports json into df
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# df <- read.csv("/workspaces/project-9/sample_data/sample_data/performance.csv")
# predictors
X <- select(merged_data, deaths, dragonKills, baronKills, firstBloodKill, firstBloodAssist, kills)
# convert first blood kill and assist to int
X <- df %>%
mutate(X$firstbloodKill = as.numeric(X$firstbloodKill), 
X$firstbloodAssist = as.numeric(X$firstbloodAssist))

# python
# target = outcome of game
 y = as.numeric(df$win)
```
